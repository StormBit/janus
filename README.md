Here we are.

You may have heard of the recent (September 2014) fallout regarding http://janus.link/ 

Well in short, Janus is dead. Nobody's maintaining it anymore. Rest in peace this magnificent beast that has empowered so many people around the world to rise up and join their networks together...and of course suffer the netsplits! 

This repository will serve as an archive for the project. 

Instructions:
--------------

1. Ask yourself: do you *really* want to be using this still?
2. Run the following: 
  * Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GLolol/janus`
  * Run `./configure`
  * Write your configuration.
  * Run janus: `./janus`
 
If you get SSL errors, run `./configure nossl` instead.

The example config is in `janus.conf.example` and the documentation is in the `doc/` directory. 

No further support will be given.
