What is this?
-------------

This is a fork of the Sourceforge version of Janus by Daniel De Graaf with the Trix-Janus Mods. I've done this because the older code lacks some of the bugs introduced in the Github version. I've stopped updating trix-janus, so use this one instead ;)

What changes did you make?
--------------------------

In short? Most of the annoying messages have been disabled. The Controller bot and it's features have been made more configurable from the conf file. A few features like custom (branded) domain names for the Janus bots, forced network tagging, colour code stripping and oper sharing level have been added in. The conf file also have been modified a bit to give a better working example and several notes have been added in to avoid confusion.

Notable Changes: There is only one InspIRCd module and one TS6 module. This was done for simplicity and you should be able to link to all modern versions of InspIRCd (1.2+ & 2.0+) as well as all the TS6 based IRCds like Ratbox, Charybdis and ShadowIRCd without any problems. Another minor change with the TS6 module is that you do not need the ircd variable anymore since the Charybdis features are enabled by default.

How do I get a copy?
--------------------

The recommended way is to use `git clone git://github.com/Trixarian/janus.git` to create a copy on your server. Using this method will give you access to the `up-git` command and make all future upgrades easier.

You can however also download a copy from https://github.com/Trixarian/janus/archive/master.tar.gz and try using `up-tar` to upgrade it, but it's not as effective as the `up-git` way.

Quick start:
------------

Run `./configure` to check module dependencies and compile multiplex.  
If you get ssl-gnutls errors then run `./configure nossl` instead.

See the example configuration for a description of what is needed there.  
After editing the configuration start janus by running `./janus`
